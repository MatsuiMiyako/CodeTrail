        <h1>Why These Methods Work</h1>
        <p>
          At Turbo Python, we believe that learning should be interactive,
          engaging, and practical. Our course is designed to help you master
          Python programming through hands-on experience and problem-solving.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="interactive-learning">
        <h2>Interactive Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional tutorials can often feel passive, but our interactive
          lessons provide immediate feedback and guidance. By practicing as you
          learn, you'll reinforce key concepts and build your skills
          incrementally. Interactive coding exercises give you the opportunity
          to experiment with Python and understand how different pieces of code
          work together.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Immediate Feedback:</strong> Our built-in code runner
            instantly checks your code, letting you know if there are any
            mistakes and providing hints for improvement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Learn by Doing:</strong> Instead of just reading or watching
            tutorials, you apply what you learn by solving real problems with
            code.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="bite-sized-lessons">
        <h2>Bite-Sized Lessons</h2>
        <p>
          Each lesson is designed to be digestible, taking only 30 minutes to 1
          hour to complete. This allows you to learn at your own pace, without
          feeling overwhelmed. Breaking down complex topics into smaller chunks
          makes learning Python more manageable and ensures that you retain what
          you’ve learned.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Easy to Digest:</strong> Small lessons prevent information
            overload and help you focus on one concept at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexible Learning:</strong> Learn at your own speed, whether
            you want to spend more time on a challenging topic or breeze through
            a concept you're already familiar with.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="project-based-learning">
        <h2>Project-Based Learning</h2>
        <p>
          We don’t just teach theory; we give you the chance to apply what
          you’ve learned through projects. Building projects allows you to see
          how Python is used in real-world scenarios, improving your
          problem-solving skills and boosting your confidence. By the end of the
          course, you will have built several projects that you can showcase in
          your portfolio.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Practical Application:</strong> Apply your knowledge by
            working on small, real-life projects that help reinforce the
            concepts you’ve learned.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Boost Your Portfolio:</strong> The projects you complete in
            this course can serve as the foundation of your Python portfolio.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="quizzes-and-reinforcement">
        <h2>Quizzes and Reinforcement</h2>
        <p>
          Quizzes are integrated throughout the course to test your
          understanding and ensure that you grasp each concept before moving on.
          Reinforcement helps you retain information and solidifies your
          foundation in Python. With instant feedback, you can quickly identify
          areas for improvement.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Active Recall:</strong> Quizzes encourage you to actively
            recall and apply information, a proven method for improving memory
            retention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Our quizzes and project
            evaluations track your progress and highlight your strengths and
            areas that need more focus.
          </li>
        </ul>
